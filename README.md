# assignment
I covered most of the Tasks in the assignment within the given time.

I took Animal as the base interface and created 4 child interfaces to it, one for each Animal's abilities.
1. IWalkable
2. ISingable
3. ISwimmable
4. IFlyable

All the animals falls into one or more of these above categories.
e.g. Bird implements the IWalkable, ISingable and IFlyable interfaces.
     Dolphin implements only the ISwimmable interfaces.
    
Based on the above structure, it's also easy to count how many animals are Walkable or Flyable.
